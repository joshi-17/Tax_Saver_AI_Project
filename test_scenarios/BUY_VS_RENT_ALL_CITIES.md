# How the Calculator Works

## Financial Components:

### Buying:
- **Cost**: Down payment + EMI (principal + interest)
- **Benefit**: Property appreciation + tax benefits
- **Net**: Final property value - total cost + tax benefits

### Renting:
- **Cost**: Monthly rent (increasing annually)
- **Benefit**: Down payment invested at 10% + (EMI-Rent) invested monthly
- **Net**: Investment gains - total rent paid

## Tax Benefits (Buying):
- Home loan interest: Up to ₹2,00,000 u/s 24(b)
- Principal repayment: Up to ₹1,50,000 u/s 80C
- Tax bracket: 31.2% (30% + 4% cess)
- Calculated year-by-year based on actual amortization

## Opportunity Cost (Renting):
- Down payment corpus invested at 10%
- If EMI > Rent, difference invested monthly at 10%
- Compounds over full loan tenure
- This is KEY to fair comparison

- All calculations account for opportunity cost
- Tax benefits calculated year-by-year (not average)
- Property appreciation compounds annually
- Rent increases annually at specified rate
- Investment returns assumed at 10% (conservative equity returns)
- Down payment = Property Value - Loan Amount
- EMI calculated using standard formula: P × r × (1+r)^n / ((1+r)^n - 1)
