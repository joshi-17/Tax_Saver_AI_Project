Risk Tolerance: Aggressive  ❌ (Wrong!)
Holding Years: 5
```

## 🎓 Pro Tip

**The Magic Word is "Conservative"**

As long as Risk Tolerance = **"Conservative"**, you will **ALWAYS** get SIP recommendation, regardless of:
- Investment amount
- Expected return
- Holding period
- Market conditions

## 📊 What the Numbers Mean

For ₹150,000 @ 15% over 5 years:

| Metric | SIP | Lump Sum |
|--------|-----|----------|
| Monthly Investment | ₹12,500 | ₹0 (one-time) |
| Initial Investment | ₹0 | ₹1,50,000 |
| Expected Final Value | ₹10.92L | ₹3.02L |
| Expected Gain | ₹9.42L | ₹1.52L |
| Tax Benefit | ₹46,800 | ₹46,800 |

**Why SIP value is higher?**
- SIP invests ₹12,500 every month for 12 months
- Total invested over the year = ₹1,50,000
- Each installment compounds for different durations
- Later investments have less time to grow

**The calculation shown is correct!**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the recommendation badge"
- Make sure you clicked "Optimize ELSS Strategy" button
- Check that Risk Tolerance is set to "Conservative"
- Try refreshing the page (press 'R' in Streamlit)

### "Values don't change when I change inputs"
- Click the button again after changing values
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
- Close and reopen the app

### "SIP shows higher returns than Lump Sum"
- This is correct for the calculation method used
- SIP compounds over 12 months, not all at once
- The formula accounts for staggered investments

It's that simple! Try it now and you'll see the ⭐ badge on the SIP card!
